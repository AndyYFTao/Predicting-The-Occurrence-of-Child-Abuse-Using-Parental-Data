# Predicting the Occurrence of Child Abuse using Parental Data

Child abuse is a controversial social concern that merits our attention to build effective prediction models for risk control. This project leverages various statistical learning techniques to find patterns in the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study dataset and classifies whether parents are likely to mistreat their children based on their socioeconomic information. Comparing variable importance yields the conclusion that parents with lower income and higher education levels are predicted with a higher probability of abusing children.

The statistical learning models involved are:

+ Logistic Regression
+ Decision Trees
+ Random Forests
+ Gradient Boosting
+ Extreme Gradient Boosting
+ Neural Networks
